## What is CDN_Captain?

CDN_Captain is a fully autonomous AI assistant for the **CDNDayz DayZ community server**. It watches every channel and thread, detects unanswered questions, and responds only when it has a **confident, sourced answer** from the website or reference channel. If it doesn't know — it says nothing.

No noise. No guessing. No "open a ticket." Either an instant, accurate answer, or total silence.

## ✅ Features

### 🌐 Knowledge & Crawling
| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Full Site Crawl** | Crawls every page on cdndayz.com (up to 200 pages) using a real headless Chromium browser — renders JavaScript so dynamic content like wipe schedules is never missed |
| **Auto-Refresh** | Re-crawls automatically every hour — always current, zero manual action |
| **Reference Channel** | Reads up to 120 messages from the server's reference channel as a second knowledge source, refreshed every 30 minutes |
| **Structured Knowledge** | After every crawl, Claude extracts all concrete facts (rules, error codes, distances, donation tiers) into a clean indexed fact list |
| **Wipe Schedule Parser** | After every crawl, a dedicated AI pass calculates the exact next wipe date and time from today |
| **Change Detection** | Every re-crawl diffs against the previous content — if a page meaningfully changes, an alert is posted to a designated staff channel |
| **Full Site Index** | Claude receives a map of every crawled page alongside content, so it can reason across the entire website — not just the top results |

### 🧠 Intelligence
| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Powered by Claude Sonnet** | One of the most capable AI models available — reasons across sources, applies rules to scenarios, handles nuanced questions |
| **Semantic Understanding** | Expands keywords before searching — "trader" also searches "exclusion zone, safe zone, market" so the right content surfaces even when phrasing differs |
| **TF-IDF Scoring** | Scores page relevance using term frequency-inverse document frequency, with exact hex error code matching getting a massive ranking bonus |
| **Auto Question Detection** | Detects questions, error reports, problem statements, and server-topic messages — not just messages ending in `?` |
| **Confidence Scoring** | Claude rates its own answer 1–10 before sending. Below 6 = silent instead of uncertain |

### 💬 Conversation Awareness
| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Deep Context** | Reads the last 75 messages for full context — knows who is talking to whom, follows reply chains |
| **Follow-up Awareness** | If someone replies to a bot answer with a follow-up, the bot retrieves the original Q&A from memory and answers in full context |
| **Two-Person Detection** | Stays out of active back-and-forth conversations between two people (within the last 2 minutes) |
| **Smart Silence** | No guessing, no vague suggestions, no "I don't know", no "open a ticket" — either useful or completely invisible |
| **🖼️ Screenshot Reading** | Reads and diagnoses error screenshots using Claude's vision — including error codes, message text, and instructions. Supports multiple screenshots per message |

### 🛡️ Admin & Safety
| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Admin Reaction Feedback** | Admins react ❌ to mark an answer wrong (bot deletes it automatically) or ✅ to confirm correct. Only protected admins trigger this |
| **Admin Tag Protection** | If someone tags a protected admin, the bot intercepts with a polite redirect to the website and ticket system |
| **Spam Protection** | 30-second per-user cooldown — won't flood any channel |
| **Answer Deduplication** | Won't repeat the same answer in the same channel within 5 minutes |
| **Rate Limit Retry** | All replies use exponential backoff — no answer is ever silently dropped |
| **Sidekick Mode** | Owner-only personal assistant — bypasses all filters, answers anything, toggleable via natural language |
| **Tamper-proof Pause** | Bot pause state is HMAC-signed with the Discord token — can't be faked by editing the database |

### 💾 Persistence
| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **SQLite Memory** | Every Q&A is stored permanently in `memory.db` — survives restarts, powers dedup, history, follow-ups, and feedback |
| **Persistent Pause State** | Pause/resume state survives bot restarts — stored with cryptographic signature |
| **Auto-restart Watchdog** | `watchdog.py` automatically restarts the bot on crash, up to 10 times per 5-minute window |

## 💬 Commands

All commands use the `!cdn` prefix.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `!cdn help` | Shows a help card with bot info and current knowledge base stats |
| `!cdn ask <question>` | Force the bot to answer any question, bypassing all auto-filters |
| `!cdn ping` | Health check — latency, uptime, memory usage, crawl age, DB size, structured facts count, and wipe schedule |
| `!cdn history` | Shows the last 10 answers the bot gave in the current channel, including confidence scores and admin feedback |
| `!cdn crawl` | Manually trigger a fresh re-crawl of cdndayz.com |
| `!cdn status` | Shows crawl age, reference channel age, model, context size, and auto-crawl schedule |

---

## 👍 Admin Feedback

Any protected admin (`5pntjoe`, `strikezx`) can react to a CDN_Captain reply:

| Reaction | Effect |
|---|---|
| ❌ | Marks the answer as **wrong** in the database and **deletes the bot's reply** from the channel |
| ✅ | Marks the answer as **correct** in the database |

Feedback is stored permanently and visible via `!cdn history`.

---

## 📋 Required Bot Permissions

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| View Channels | Monitor channels for questions |
| Send Messages | Reply to questions |
| Read Message History | Load conversation context (75 messages) |
| Embed Links | Send formatted embeds for commands |

## 🖥️ Installation

### Option A — Download the .exe (Recommended)

1. Go to [**Releases**](https://github.com/InfamousMorningstar/CDN_Captain-bot-/releases/latest) and download `CDN_Captain.exe`
2. Double-click it — the installer opens
3. Enter your **Anthropic API key** ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com))
4. Click **Install & Start Bot**

The installer will:
- Auto-download and install Python if not found
- Download all bot files from this repo
- Install all Python dependencies
- Install the Playwright Chromium browser
- Write your credentials to `.env`
- Launch the bot automatically

Everything installs to `~/CDN_Captain/` in your home directory.

---

### Option B — Run from Source

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+, pip

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/InfamousMorningstar/CDN_Captain-bot-.git
cd CDN_Captain-bot-

# 2. Run the setup script (installs all dependencies)
setup.bat

# 3. Create your .env file
# (setup.bat will prompt you if it doesn't exist)
```

Create a `.env` file in the project folder:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

Start the bot with auto-restart (recommended):

```bash
python watchdog.py
```

Or run directly (no watchdog):

```bash
python bot.py
```

---

### Change Alert Setup

To receive alerts when cdndayz.com updates, set this in `bot.py`:

CHANGE_ALERT_CHANNEL_ID = 123456789012345678  # your staff channel ID
```

Leave as `None` to disable.

## 🔨 Building the .exe

The `.exe` bundles the installer GUI with a pre-embedded Discord token so admins only need to enter their Anthropic API key.

```bash
# 1. Open build_exe.bat and set your Discord token
# 2. Run it
build_exe.bat
```

The output `CDN_Captain.exe` is ready to distribute.

> **Never commit `build_exe.bat` with a real token inside it.** Add it to `.gitignore` or always use a placeholder.
